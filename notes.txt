amplitude inductive bias
    at first, i thought: assume most amplitude to be 0. Like a lasso loss. 
    However, imagine: the trumpet time is the superset of violin time. then, under lasso, it would model the violin as containing the trumpet sound, and let trumpet amplitude reach 0 while violin is playing. 
    So, instead of penalizing amplitude, we should penalize amplitude change. Two ways:
        - add a loss. 
        - represent time-amplitude with neural implicit field. (let NN low-freq inductive bias do the work)

A piece is a set of instrument tracks. 

An instrument track is:
    f0(t). intermediate
    amplitude(t). requires grad
    vocal only: 2/3-dim vowel embedding. requires grad

f0 is:
    pitch. scaler. 
    octave: 16-dim multi-hot vector. 
    
    sum the three octaves near the max in forward pass. 

About optim
    Parallel may not be important. If algo good, converge fast, few shot, then optim for GPU may be harmful and unecessary. 

merge instrument tracks. conditions:
    - amplitude-weighted f0-chroma doesn't conflict
    AND
        - amplitude is similar
        OR
        - timbre is similar
    Why is this necessary?
        just start with the right number of tracks?
        start with 1 track and gradually add tracks until loss doesn't decrease?

variational neural implicit field
    perturb the input

VENIF
    variational encoder of neural implicit fields
    inspired by wave cube synthesis. 
    what if you can stack NIFs, add VAE-like noise, and interpolate between NIFs? 
    The rationale: make different NIFs dedicate similar NN locations to related tasks. Make different NIFs robust to brain-interference. 
    Next, combine with VAE. 
    Image - encoder - reparametrize - 2d weight-bias field
    XY coord - 2d weight-bias field as NN - RGB
    It's a VAE with an oracle decoder, where the oracle decoder is an interpreter to interpret latent field as NN. 
    
    experiment
        interpolate between similar images. 
            tranlsate view?
            scale?
            same scene, diff camera?
            same object, diff style?
            swap multiple objects?

Stretched partials:
    important? no? 
    neural implicit field?

reverb:
    important? no?
